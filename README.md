## Background

Abdul and Fiona came to the hackathon with the idea to create some type of webapp to help university students manage their finances. We brainstormed for a while and thought that the best way to do so is to allow students to visualize how they spend their money. From here, BudgetBuddy was born.

## How we built it

We used Node.JS to write the backend which connects to a Mongo database to store user information and process login requests. For the front end, we used bootstrap as a CSS framework and added our own custom CSS to improve the look and feel of the webapp.
